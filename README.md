# hello-world
Just starting out with GitHub
I'm Joe.   I'm learning Python, and taking the OSCP and just trying to familiarize myself with GitHub due to the large amount of PoC exploits I see linked from GitHub accounts.  I'm also hoping to enroll in Georgia Techs OMSCS and would like to have something to share on my application
